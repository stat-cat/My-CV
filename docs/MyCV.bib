	abstract = {Studies that investigate the performance of prognostic and predictive biomarkers are commonplace in medicine. Evaluating the performance of biomarkers is challenging in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other conditions when both the time factor (i.e. time from injury to biomarker measurement) and different levels or doses of treatments are in play. Such factors need to be accounted for when assessing the biomarker’s performance in relation to a clinical outcome. The Hyperbaric Oxygen in Brain Injury Treatment (HOBIT) trial, a phase II randomized control clinical trial seeks to determine the dose of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for treating severe TBI that has the highest likelihood of demonstrating efficacy in a phase III trial. Hyperbaric Oxygen in Brain Injury Treatment will study up to 200 participants with severe TBI. This paper discusses the statistical approaches to assess the prognostic and predictive performance of the biomarkers studied in this trial, where prognosis refers to the association between a biomarker and the clinical outcome while the predictiveness refers to the ability of the biomarker to identify patient subgroups that benefit from therapy. Analyses based on initial biomarker levels accounting for different levels of HBOT and other baseline clinical characteristics, and analyses of longitudinal changes in biomarker levels are discussed from a statistical point of view. Methods for combining biomarkers that are of complementary nature are also considered and the relevant algorithms are illustrated in detail along with an extensive simulation study that assesses the performance of the statistical methods. Even though the discussed approaches are motivated by the HOBIT trial, their applications are broader. They can be applied in studies assessing the predictiveness and prognostic ability of biomarkers in relation to a well-defined therapeutic intervention and clinical outcome.},

              Background
              Our randomized controlled clinical trial will explore the potential of bazedoxifene plus conjugated estrogen to modulate breast tissue-based risk biomarkers as a surrogate for breast cancer risk reduction. This paper investigates the statistical design features of the trial and the rationale for the final choice of its design. Group sequential designs are a popular design approach to allow a trial to stop early for success or futility, potentially saving time and money over a fixed trial design. While Bayesian adaptive designs enjoy the same properties as group sequential designs, they have the added benefit of using prior information as well as inferential interpretation conditional on the data. Whether a frequentist or Bayesian trial, most adaptive designs have interim analyses that allow for early stopping, typically utilizing only the primary endpoint. A drawback to this approach is that the study may not have enough data for adequate comparisons of a single, key secondary endpoint. This can happen, for example, if the secondary endpoint has a smaller effect than the primary endpoint.
            
            
              Methods
              In this paper, we investigate a trial design called two-endpoint adaptive, which stops early only if a criterion is met for primary and secondary endpoints. The approach focuses the final analysis on the primary endpoint but ensures adequate data for the secondary analysis. Our study has two arms with a primary (change in mammographic fibroglandular volume) and secondary endpoint (change in mammary tissue Ki-67).
            
            
              Results
              We present operating characteristics including power, trial duration, and type I error rate and discuss the value and risks of modeling Bayesian group sequential designs with primary and secondary endpoints, comparing against alternative designs. The results indicate that the two-endpoint adaptive design has better operating characteristics than competing designs if one is concerned about having adequate information for a key secondary endpoint.
            
            
              Discussion
              Our approach balances trial speed and the need for information on the single, key secondary endpoint.},

Colon cancer impacts the lives of Kansans and those across the United State.(1, 2) Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, such as panitumumab and cetuximab, have gained popularity as first-line treatment for stage 4 colon cancer despite their toxicities.(3-5) EGFR inhibitors are an efficacious first-line treatment for stage 4 colon cancer, but no study has investigated outcomes comparing EGFR inhibitors as first-line treatment to it used as second- or third-line treatment. This study investigates EGFR inhibitor therapy estimated survival when used as first-, second-, and third-line.
Methods. A retrospective review was done for patients with stage 4 colon cancer who underwent EGFR inhibitor treatment at a large academic center from November 2007 to August 2021. The patients were stratified into five groups by the line in which they received the EGFR inhibitor treatment. A log-rank test was used to analyze the groups, and the median survival for each group was determined.
Results. A total of 68 patients were reviewed; 18 received first-line, 23 received second-line, 18 received third-line, 6 received fourth-line, and 3 received sixth-line treatment with an EGFR inhibitor. Fourth- and sixth-line therapies were excluded due to the small patient size. There was no significant difference in estimated survival time between any of the lines. Median survival of the therapies was found.
Conclusions. There is no statistical difference in survival when EGFR inhibitors are used as first-, second-, or third-line for stage 4 colon cancer which should be considered when prescribing chemotherapy second- or third-line for this cancer.},

              Introduction
              Implementing a health system-based hypertension programme may lower blood pressure (BP).
            
            
              Methods
              We performed a randomized, controlled pilot study to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of a home-based virtual hypertension programme integrating evidence-based strategies to overcome current barriers to BP control. Trained clinical pharmacists staffed the virtual collaborative care clinic (vCCC) to remotely manage hypertension using a BP dashboard and phone “visits” to monitor BP, adherence, side effects of medications, and prescribe anti-hypertensives. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were identified via electronic health records. Enrolled patients were randomized to either vCCC or usual care for 3 months. We assessed patients’ home BP monitoring behaviour, and patients’, physicians’, and pharmacists’ perspectives on feasibility and acceptability of individual programme components.
            
            
              Results
              Thirty-one patients (vCCC = 17, usual care = 14) from six physician clinics completed the pilot study. After 3 months, average BP decreased in the vCCC arm (P = 0.01), but not in the control arm (P = 0.45). The vCCC participants measured BP more (9.9 vs. 1.2 per week, P \&lt; 0.001). There were no intervention-related adverse events. Participating physicians (n = 6), pharmacists (n = 5), and patients (n = 31) rated all programme components with average scores of \&gt;4.0, a pre-specified benchmark. Nine adaptations in vCCC design and delivery were made based on potential barriers to implementing the programme and suggestions.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A home-based virtual hypertension programme using team-based care, technology, and a logical integration of evidence-based strategies is safe, acceptable, and feasible to intended users. These pilot data support studies to assess the effectiveness of this programme at a larger scale.},

	abstract = {Approximately 40\% of patients with cancer are eligible for check-point inhibitor (CPI) therapy. Little research has examined the potential cognitive impact of CPIs. First-line CPI therapy offers a unique research opportunity without chemotherapy-related confounders. The purpose of this prospective, observational pilot was to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of prospective recruitment, retention, and neurocognitive assessment for older adults receiving first-line CPI(s) and (2) provide preliminary evidence of changes in cognitive function associated with CPI(s). Patients receiving first-line CPI(s) (CPI Group) were assessed at baseline (n = 20) and 6 months (n = 13) for self-report of cognitive function and neurocognitive test performance. Results were compared to age-matched controls without cognitive impairment assessed annually by the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). Plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline and 6 months for the CPI Group. Estimated differences for CPI Group scores prior to initiating CPIs (baseline) trended to lower performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Blind (MOCA-Blind) test compared to the ADRC controls (p = 0.066). Controlling for age, the CPI Group’s 6-months MOCA-Blind performance was lower than the ADRC control group’s 12-months performance (p = 0.011). No significant differences in biomarkers were detected between baseline and 6 months, although significant correlations were noted for biomarker change and cognitive performance at 6 months. IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, FGF2, and VEGF were inversely associated with Craft Story Recall performance (p {\textless} 0.05), e.g., higher levels correlated with poorer memory performance. Higher IGF-1 and VEGF correlated with better letter-number sequencing and digit-span backwards performance, respectively. Unexpected inverse correlation was noted between IL-1α and Oral Trail-Making Test B completion time. CPI(s) may have a negative impact on some neurocognitive domains and warrant further investigation. A multi-site study design may be crucial to fully powering prospective investigation of the cognitive impact of CPIs. Establishment of a multi-site observational registry from collaborating cancer centers and ADRCs is recommended.},

              Background
              Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are elevated in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whether this is due to deceased kidney clearance or increased production, and how they change with kidney transplant (KT), is unclear.
            
            
              Method
              We examined serum AD biomarkers from CKD patients pre‐ to post‐KT and compared findings with controls without CKD or AD. Analyses were performed on a Simoa HD‐X, using pTau181 and Neuro 4 Plex E assays.
              Age was used for covariate adjustment in linear mixed models (LMM) analyzing phosphorylated tau 181 (ptau181), neurofilament light (NfL), amyloid beta (AB42, AB40, 42/40), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Change in p‐tau181 was our primary outcome. LMM included age and levels for control, pre‐KT, or 12‐weeks or 1‐year post‐KT. Based on residual patterns, the natural log (In) of each measure was used for final analyses. Linear contrasts were used to generate estimated differences between group/time points from age‐adjusted models. These included averaged pre‐KT, post‐KT, and control comparisons. Two degree‐of‐freedom tests compared the post‐KT measures to pre‐KT and controls.
            
            
              Result
              The 59 CKD patients were 52±12 years old and 13 controls were 51±8 years old. Pre‐KT, ln(p‐tau181) was higher than controls (p{\textless}0.0001) and post‐KT (p{\textless}0.0001) (Figure). Post‐KT p‐tau181 greatly decreased but remained higher than controls (p = 0.0004). There was no difference between 12 weeks and 1 year post‐KT levels (p = 0.70). ln(pTau) increased with age (p = 0.06). ln(NfL) followed a similar pattern; pre‐KT levels were higher than controls (p{\textless}0.0001) and post‐KT (p{\textless}0.0001). Post‐KT levels decreased but remained higher than controls (p{\textless}0.0001). 12‐week and 1‐year post‐KT levels did not differ (p = 0.57). Levels increased with age (p{\textless}0.0001). Pre‐KT AB42 was higher than controls (p{\textless}0.0001) and post‐KT (p{\textless}0.0001). Post‐KT, levels decreased but remained higher than controls (p = 0.005) and continued declining 1‐year post‐transplant (p = 0.01). In(AB40) and In(GFAP) showed the same pattern. The AB42/AB40 was not different pre‐KT vs controls (p = 0.58) and did not change following KT. Cognitive function improved post‐KT. Patients with residual kidney function had lower baseline levels of AD blood biomarkers.
            
            
              Conclusion
              In severe CKD, blood biomarkers of AD are dependent on kidney function and caution should be used in interpreting them.},
